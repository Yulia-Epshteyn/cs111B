o	The user clicks a button to make their move (rock, paper, or scissors).
o	The program randomly generates a move for the computer.
o	The moves are displayed as images.
o	The program determines and displays the outcome of this one round and updates user’s balance.
o	The user can play as many rounds as they want.
o	The program keeps track of and displays the number of computer wins, user wins, and ties across all rounds.

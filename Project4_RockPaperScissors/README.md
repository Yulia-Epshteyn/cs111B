The game works this way:
In a single round:
* The program asks a user if they want to bet. If yes, it asks to enter a betting amount and keeps track of the user's balance.
* The user clicks a button to make their move (rock, paper, or scissors).
* The program randomly generates a move for the computer.
* The moves are displayed as images.
* The program determines and displays the outcome of the round and updates user's balance.
* The user can play as many rounds as they want.
* The program counts and displays the number of computer wins, user wins, and ties across all rounds.
